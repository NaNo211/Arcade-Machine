# Arcade-Machine
Arcade-Machine building project

### we are demonstrating how to build full bartop arcade by using raspberry pi 4 
### Our main purpose in this project is to entertain and to bring back the legacy that is left behind during the golden age of gaming for the 90s kids.

# Our steps of the project:
1. we searched in the Arcade body for CNC cut and thanks for grabcade we find 3D design here !(https://grabcad.com/library/bartop-arcade-cabinet-wip-1) and you will find the f3d file in the repository however we put our modification for our components. 
2. we searched for the components for our project and that is the list:
    - Raspberry Pi 4 2GB RAM.
    - LCD 19 INCH.
    - LCD Controller Board.
    - LCD Power Board.
    - Joysticks.
    - Push Buttons.
    - Micro Switches.
    - Speakers.
    - power adapter for raspberry pi.
    - arcade encoder for joysticks and push buttons.
3. we desinged our secametaic for the connections and you will find the .fzz here !(https://github.com/NaNo211/Arcade-Machine/blob/main/design.fzz).
4. we installed an emulator in the raspberry and we used for that "Recallbox" the link here !(https://www.recalbox.com)
5. we started to mount the connection:
    - for the controller setup : we find a problem in the controller that there is no find of the arcade encoder however we found a solution thank for Alan Chatham by using UnoJoy by changing Arduino Uno or Aduino mega into a PS3-compatible USB game controller and you will find the steps here !(https://github.com/AlanChatham/UnoJoy). so we used 2 Arduino uno for this project and it's very well.
    - for the display we used 19 philips monitor and we attached LCD controller board for the analog signals you will find on amazon here !(https://www.amazon.com/VSDISPLAY-Controller-LP140WH1-BT140XW02-Backlight/dp/B01N5J57YP/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=lcd+controller+board&qid=1644002950&sr=8-6) and we used powerboard for the LCD here !(https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32814652731.html)
    - for the sound system we used 2 speakers 10W and amplifier connteced to raspberry pi 4 however maker sure the amplifier can handel 2 channel 10W
    - we will tweak our project by adding our poster and put RGB lights controller by sound.

# Updates :
### we will still update the project by putting coin acceptor and make the arcade portable so make sure to wait for the update.
